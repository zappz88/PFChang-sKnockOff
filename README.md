Current implementation uses bootstrap for styling which anybody who uses it knows that while it is good for basic implementations of sites and modeling, the application of it can lead to excessive code because of its building block nature. I could easily apply custom styling which would be of better use since I could more effectively apply flexbox or grid for sizing and different devices, but currently this was an experiment of building what I understand as a "lux site". After reviewing the sites pages there is a very real similarity between most of them with the header and footer largely being left unchanged except for a few changes here and there, but the overall site just changes the body content. Some spots show some spotty parts particularly how it has a snap effect when the menu bar sticks to the top of screen which could be adjusted through better application of javascript calculations. It happens whether it is slow or quick, meaning that the positions are off when it comes to the position being applied. Overall, a well-designed site with good design cues, and reminiscent of what you'd find on wordpress (which it might be). Other sections include sign up and login which should be basic procedure calls, but they for some reason made it to where the page reloads when a choice is made. May be due to functionality issues or not understanding an application of the display property similar to what is used in the site navigation on window resizing.
